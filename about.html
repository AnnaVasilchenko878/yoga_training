                    <h3>Basic Step</h3>
                    <p>This class is designed for first time yogis. It's the right class for you if you want to learn
                        the fundamentals of yoga in a group where everyone is new. The teacher will give you some
                        background on yoga while you're seated, but come prepared to move. You’ll walk out feeling
                        embodied, empowered, energized, and eager to come back.</p>

                    <p>We recommend any of our classes that are designated as Level 1, such as Hatha, YogaWorks, and
                        Flow. Level 1 caters to beginning students and focuses on the basics. You'll be surrounded by
                        both brand new and returning practitioners as well as more advanced yogis who want to work on
                        beginning poses.</p>

                    <p>The slower pace of Wand Yoga Gentle classes make them a great choice if you want a less strenuous
                        approach to your practice. These extremely accessible classes are perfect for anyone looking to
                        develop a practice of conscious, mindful movement with some support—from seniors to pregnant
                        women to world-class athletes.</p>
